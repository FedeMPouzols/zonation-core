## Zonation core

Zonation is a spatial conservation prioritization framework for
large-scale conservation planning. It identifies areas, or landscapes,
important for retaining high habitat quality and connectivity for
multiple biodiversity features (eg. species), providing a quantitative
method for enhancing species' long term persistence.

Essentially, this software is a decision support tool for all
non-commercial parties working on conservation issues. As Zonation
operates on large grids, it provides a direct link between GIS,
statistical distribution modeling and spatial conservation
prioritization.

This repository contains the computational core of Zonation software.
It does not contain the graphical user interface (GUI) components.

You can dowload the latest stable release installers from the CBIG website

## Quick start

For instructions on how to compile Zonation core on Linux (Ubuntu 14.04), please see

Do not use this software if you disagree with the disclaimer or

with the best of intentions, it is quite beyond one small research
group to ensure its correct operation under all operating systems and
environments. Anticipating all potential combinations of erroneous
input has not been possible. Therefore, use the software with care and
make an effort to understand how the inputs connect to outputs.

## Attribution

Zonation uses the following libraries: 
- boost (http://www.boost.org)
- FFTW (http://www.fftw.org). We also used
