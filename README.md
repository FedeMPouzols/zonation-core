## Zonation

Zonation is a spatial conservation prioritization framework for
large-scale conservation planning. It identifies areas, or landscapes,
important for retaining high habitat quality and connectivity for
multiple biodiversity features (eg. species), providing a quantitative
method for enhancing species' long term persistence.

Essentially, this software is a decision support tool for all
non-commercial parties working on conservation issues. As Zonation
operates on large grids, it provides a direct link between GIS,
statistical distribution modeling and spatial conservation
prioritization.

The Zonation framework is presently under constant development. Keep
an eye on our web site: http://cbig.it.helsinki.fi

with the best of intentions, it is quite beyond one small research
group to ensure its correct operation under all operating systems and
environments. Anticipating all potential combinations of erroneous
input has not been possible. Therefore, use the software with care and
make an effort to understand how the inputs connect to outputs.
