    Zonation is a conservation planning framework and software. It produces a hierarchical prioritization of the landscape based on the occurrence levels of biodiversity features in sites (cells) by iteratively removing the least valuable remaining cell while accounting for connectivity and generalized complementarity. The output of Zonation can be imported into GIS software to create maps or for further analysis. Zonation v. 4.0 can process very large data sets containing up to ~50 million grid cells with effective data.
